# code_phase2to3_SESSR

This repository includes R files that contain the functions for empirically or analytically calculating the overall type I error of the adaptive design proposed in the paper [Tian Z, Wu L, Liu R, Lin J. A Flexible Seamless Phase 2/3 Design with Biomarker-Driven Subgroup Enrichment and Sample Size Re-estimation. Under Review.] For questions or comments about the code, please email Zizhong Tian at zqt5121@psu.edu.

Empirical_tIe_Cmin_Example.R = Functions for calculating the empirical overall type I error of the proposed adaptive design using simulations. Illustrative examples for calculating the type I error and identifying the C_min value are provided.

Analytical_tIe_Cmin_Example.R = Functions for implementing the analytical overall type I error formula of the proposed adaptive design as proposed in the manuscript. Illustrative examples for calculating the type I error and identifying the C_min value are provided.
